subheading: "String Refs is an old legacy API which is discouraged and is going
  to be deprecated in the future:"
excerpt: In the future, we will provide an automated script (a “codemod”) to
  migrate away from String Refs. However, some rare cases can’t be migrated
  automatically. This release adds a new warning only for those cases in advance
  of the deprecation.

# How to create JavaScript Proxy

The syntax of JavaScript Proxy is simple. It is also easy to create new Proxy. The Proxy object takes two parameters. The first one is`target`. This is the object whose behavior you want to change. This is important. Creating new JavaScript Proxy and applying it to some object will change only that one object, nothing else.

This also means one thing. If you want to apply some Proxy to multiple objects, you have to apply that Proxy to all those objects. To the second parameter. This parameter is`handler`. The`handler`parameter is an object. Inside this object are methods to control the behaviors of the object specified as the`target`.

The methods inside the`handler`object are called traps. So, the next time your hear about JavaScript Proxy and traps, think about methods that control behavior of target object. Last thing. JavaScript Proxy is an object. So, to create new you have to use the`new`keyword. What you get is`new Proxy(target, handler)`.

```jsx
{!!relatedArticles &&
  <S.ToolbarSection>
    <h5 className="title">Similar Posts</h5>
    {relatedArticles.map(({ node: post }) => (
      <Link to={post.fields.slug} key={post.id}>
        <div className="anchor-title">{post.frontmatter.title}</div>
        <div className="anchor-body">{post.frontmatter.subheading}</div>
      </Link>
    ))}
  </S.ToolbarSection>
}
```
